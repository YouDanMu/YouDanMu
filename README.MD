> Danmaku on YouTube!

Floating comment (_Danmu_ in Chinese, or _Danmaku_ in Japanese) is a comment system originated in Japan and China and now become popular being used on video-sharing website across Asia. Instead of traditional comment system, it features each comment on the video with a timestamp, and fly through the screen at the designated time, when the viewers are watching the video. It often creates another level of fun or being explanatory to the video. It all depends on how much the viewers participate in the video. However, the most widely used video-sharing website on the planet, YouTube, is missing this feature and most of the popular videos have the same videos uploaded to various websites, including those with floating comments feature. We want to bring this feature to YouTube by developing a browser add-on that loads and renders the floating comments from other websites with floating comments for the same video on YouTube. Moreover, while the user can send out floating comments on the video with the add-on, the add-on features that the comments can be submitted back to the source websites as well.

## Features

* Develop a browser add-on that can render floating comments from the other websites on the same video which on YouTube.
* Collect floating comments from YouTube users and merge the data with other websites. All floating comments will be sent as anonymous on YouTube.
* Create a control system that helps users customize their own comments with color, font size, and where it would appear. Also, users can simply close the floating comments system.
* If time permitting: Users can choose to submit their YouTube comments back to source websites.
